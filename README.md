## üì¶ Building the Project

This project is set up for packaging using Pyinstaller in a Python virtual environment (venv) with Python 3.6.15 installed via PyENV on Ubuntu 22.04 (Linux 6.5.0-41-generic #41~22.04.2-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC). The following instructions are based on this setup. If you're using a different system, you may need to make appropriate adjustments (or download the latest pre-compiled version to avoid these potentially tedious steps):

- Install Pyinstaller:
```bash
pip3 install pyinstaller
```

- Package the application using the pre-designed .SPEC file (refer to the file for more details):
```bash
pyinstaller --clean flipmad.spec
```

- Copy the WEB folder to the same directory as the generated binary:
```bash
cp -r web/ dist/
```

- Grant execution permissions to the generated binary:
```bash
cd dist/
```
```bash
sudo chmod +x FGIFMaker
```

Great! You've now successfully compiled the software. You can run it using:
```bash
./FGIFMaker
```
